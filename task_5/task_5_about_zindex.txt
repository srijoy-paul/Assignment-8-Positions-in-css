z-index: z-index is a CSS property that determines the stacking order of positioned elements on the z-axis (the axis coming out of the screen toward the viewer). It is used to control the visual stacking of overlapping elements. Then with a higher z-index value is displayed in front of elements lower z-index values.

CODE EXAMPLE: 

<!-- HTML: -->
<section id="main-container">
        <article id="box-container1">
          Ex1
          <div class="box" id="box1">1</div>
          <div class="box" id="box2">2</div>
        </article>
        <article id="box-container2">
          Ex2
          <div class="box" id="box3">3</div>
          <div class="box" id="box4">4</div>
        </article>
</section>
<-- HTML Ends -->

/* CSS */
#box-container1 {
  /*contains box 1 and box 2, which were in overlapping position*/
  position: relative;
}
#box-container2 {
  /*contains box 3 and box 4, which were in overlapping position*/
  left: 305px;
  position: relative;
}
#box1 {
  z-index: 0;
}
#box2 {
  z-index: 1;
  top: 79px;
  left: 20px;
}
#box3 {
  z-index: 1;
}
#box4 {
  z-index: 0;
  top: 79px;
  left: 20px;
}
/* CSS Ends */



Here, in #box-container1 there are two boxes in overlapping condition due to absolute positioning of the boxes and #box-container1 was relatively positioned. So, here the second box box2 has higher z-index so it is stacked over box1.

Meanwhile, in #box-container2 there are two boxes in overlapping condition due to absolute positioning of the boxes and #box-container2 was relatively positioned. So, here the first box box3 has higher z-index so it is stacked over box4.
